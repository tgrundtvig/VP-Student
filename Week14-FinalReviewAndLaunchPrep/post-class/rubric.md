# Week 14 Self-Assessment Rubric: Project Launch

This is the final self-assessment. It evaluates both your implementation roadmap and your
actual project setup.

## Implementation Roadmap (40 points)

| Criterion | Excellent (5) | Good (3) | Needs Work (1) |
|-----------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| **Phases** | 4+ clear phases with milestones | 3 phases defined | Fewer than 3 phases |
| **Task breakdown** | Specific tasks with class/file names | Mostly specific | Vague tasks |
| **Priorities** | P1/P2/P3 clearly separated | Some prioritization | No priorities |
| **Time estimates** | Realistic with buffer time | Estimates provided | Unrealistic or missing |
| **Demo plan** | Detailed feature-by-feature script | Features listed | Vague or missing |
| **Risk assessment** | Risks identified with mitigations | Some risks noted | Not addressed |
| **Completeness** | All sections filled in with detail | Most sections complete | Significant gaps |
| **Realism** | Achievable in 2 weeks, honest about limitations | Mostly realistic | Over-optimistic |

**My score:** ___ / 40

## Project Setup (40 points)

| Criterion | Excellent (5) | Good (3) | Needs Work (1) |
|-----------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| **Maven project** | Compiles with Java 21, JUnit 5 | Mostly configured | Does not compile |
| **Package structure** | Matches architecture layers perfectly | Most packages correct | Missing packages |
| **Interface files** | All interfaces with JavaDoc | Interfaces present | Incomplete |
| **Record files** | All records with factory methods and toString | Records present | Incomplete |
| **Test doubles** | MockView + InMemoryRepo complete | Partially implemented | Missing |
| **Test files** | All test categories present | Some tests present | Few or no tests |
| **Git initialized** | Initial commit with .gitignore | Git initialized | No git |
| **Compiles** | `mvn clean compile` succeeds | Compiles with warnings | Does not compile |

**My score:** ___ / 40

## Readiness (20 points)

| Criterion | Excellent (5) | Good (3) | Needs Work (1) |
|-----------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| **First task clarity** | Know exactly what to implement first | General idea | Unsure |
| **Design documents** | All documents from Weeks 11-13 available | Most available | Missing documents |
| **Tool readiness** | IntelliJ, Maven, Git all working | Mostly working | Setup issues |
| **Confidence** | Can explain why design will work | Somewhat confident | Low confidence |

**My score:** ___ / 20

## Total Score

| Category | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Implementation Roadmap | ___ / 40 |
| Project Setup | ___ / 40 |
| Readiness | ___ / 20 |
| **Total** | **___ / 100** |

## Score Interpretation

- **90-100:** Fully prepared, ready to implement immediately
- **75-89:** Well prepared, minor setup tasks remaining
- **60-74:** Partially prepared, need to finish setup before starting implementation
- **Below 60:** Significant preparation needed --- prioritize project setup this weekend

## Final Reflection

1. What is the single most important thing you learned during the design phase (Weeks 11-14)?

2. Looking back, what would you design differently?

3. What are you most looking forward to implementing?

4. What is your biggest concern about the implementation period?

5. How will you stay on track during the 2 weeks?

## Congratulations

You have completed the design phase of your exam project. Over the past four weeks you have:
- Created a project architecture
- Specified complete interfaces with JavaDoc
- Written a comprehensive test suite
- Set up a real Maven project
- Planned your implementation roadmap

**The design is done. Now make it real.**

Good luck with your implementation!
