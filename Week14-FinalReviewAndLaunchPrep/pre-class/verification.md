# Week 14 Pre-Class Verification

## Before Class Checklist

Complete this checklist to verify you are ready for the final session.

### Reading Complete
- [ ] I have read "From Design to Implementation" (pre-class reading)
- [ ] I understand the implementation order (bottom-up: Model -> Repository -> Controller -> View)
- [ ] I know how to set up a Maven project with Java 21 and JUnit 5
- [ ] I know how to create a package structure matching my architecture

### Implementation Roadmap Complete
- [ ] I have filled in all fields in `ImplementationRoadmap.java`
- [ ] All tests pass when I run `mvn test`
- [ ] I have at least 4 implementation phases
- [ ] I have task breakdowns with specific files and classes
- [ ] I have prioritized tasks (P1/P2/P3)
- [ ] I have realistic time estimates
- [ ] I have a demo plan

### Design Documents Ready
- [ ] I have my Week 11 architecture document
- [ ] I have my Week 12 interface specification and design document
- [ ] I have my Week 13 test plan and test code
- [ ] All documents are updated with any changes from peer reviews

### Development Environment Ready
- [ ] IntelliJ IDEA is installed and working
- [ ] Java 21 is installed (`java --version` shows 21.x)
- [ ] Maven is installed and working (`mvn --version` works)
- [ ] Git is installed (`git --version` works)
- [ ] I know how to create a new Maven project in IntelliJ

### Mental Preparation
- [ ] I know what my first implementation task will be
- [ ] I know what "done" looks like for my MVP
- [ ] I am prepared to start coding tonight after class

## Running Verification

```bash
cd pre-class/exercises
mvn test
```

**Expected output:** All tests should pass.

## If Tests Fail

The tests verify:
1. At least 4 phases are defined
2. Task breakdowns are specific
3. Priorities include P1 (Must Have) tasks
4. Time estimates are realistic (10-60 total hours)
5. Demo plan is detailed
6. Risk assessment is provided

Read the assertion messages for specific guidance.

## Final Questions to Bring to Class

- Any last design questions before implementation starts?
- Any concerns about scope or time?
- Any technical setup issues (Maven, Java, IntelliJ)?
- Any questions about the exam format or expectations?
