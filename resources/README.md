# Resources

This folder contains supplementary course resources such as additional reading
material, reference diagrams, and optional study aids.

For the main reference material used throughout the course, see the
[quick-reference/](../quick-reference/) folder, which contains the interface
design checklist and other essential guides.

## Folder Contents

Files will be added here as the course progresses. Check back after each
class session for any new materials.

## Questions?

If you are looking for something specific and cannot find it, ask during
the next class session or refer to the weekly README files in each
`WeekNN-*/` folder for that week's materials.
