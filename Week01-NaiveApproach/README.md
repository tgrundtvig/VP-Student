# Week 1: The Naive Approach

Welcome to Week 1! This week, we're going to build a simple text-based game the "normal" way - focusing on getting something working quickly. This sets the foundation for understanding why better design approaches exist.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Review and apply basic Java OOP concepts (classes, objects, methods)
- Design and implement a simple text-based game
- Use basic Java collections (ArrayList, HashMap)
- Write simple methods and class structures
- Experience rapid prototyping and iterative development

## Time Estimate

- **Pre-class work**: 1.5-2 hours
- **Class session**: 3 hours (17:00-20:00)
- **Post-class exercises**: 2-3 hours

## Overview

This week is about **building something that works**. We're not worried about perfect design, comprehensive testing, or future maintainability. The goal is to:

1. Refresh your Java knowledge
2. Build confidence by completing a working program
3. Experience the joy of rapid development
4. Set a baseline for comparison in Week 2

Think of this as "coding like you normally would" - instinctive, practical, get-it-done programming.

## Before Class (Mandatory)

### 1. Read the Material

Read [pre-class/reading.md](pre-class/reading.md) which covers:
- Java refresher (classes, objects, methods)
- Basic OOP concepts
- Collections basics
- Simple game design

### 2. Complete Pre-Class Exercises

Work through the exercises in [pre-class/exercises/](pre-class/exercises/):
1. Navigate to the exercises folder
2. Read the README.md
3. Complete the Java refresher exercises
4. Run the tests: `mvn test`
5. All tests should pass ✅

### 3. Verify Your Understanding

See [pre-class/verification.md](pre-class/verification.md) for a self-check. If your tests are green, you're ready for class!

## In Class

We'll build a **text-based RPG game** together through live coding:

### Part 1 (17:10-18:20): Core Game
- Player character with health and attack
- Monster enemies
- Basic combat system
- Simple game loop

### Break (18:20-18:30)
☕ Stretch, coffee, bathroom break

### Part 2 (18:30-19:20): Add Features
- Inventory system
- Multiple items and weapons
- Enhanced combat mechanics

### Part 3 (19:20-20:00): Start Homework
- Begin post-class exercises
- Clarify expectations
- Get help with setup

## After Class

### 1. Complete Post-Class Exercises

Work through [post-class/exercises/](post-class/exercises/):
- Extend the game with new features
- Add more complexity
- Experiment with different mechanics

Run `mvn test` to check your progress.

### 2. Use the Hints

If you get stuck, check [post-class/hints.md](post-class/hints.md) for guidance (not full solutions).

### 3. Self-Assess

Use [post-class/rubric.md](post-class/rubric.md) to evaluate your work.

### 4. Optional: Try Extensions

If you finish early and want more challenge, explore [post-class/extensions/](post-class/extensions/).

## Key Concepts

This week introduces:

- **Classes and Objects**: Modeling game entities
- **Methods**: Implementing game actions
- **Collections**: Managing multiple entities
- **State Management**: Tracking game state
- **User Input**: Interactive console programs

## What's Coming Next Week?

Week 2 will challenge you to **extend** your game significantly. You'll discover:
- What happens when requirements change
- How hard it is to test the current design
- Why tight coupling causes problems
- What pain points exist in "naive" design

This experience will motivate the interface-first approach introduced in Week 3.

## Getting Help

- **During class**: Ask questions! This is collaborative learning.
- **After class**: [Communication channel TBD]
- **Stuck on exercises?**: Check hints, ask classmates, use office hours

## Important Notes

### Don't Worry About

- Perfect design (not the goal this week)
- Comprehensive testing (we'll get there)
- Extensibility (Week 2's concern)
- Design patterns (coming in Week 3+)

### Do Focus On

- Getting it working
- Understanding the code
- Completing the exercises
- Having fun!

## Success Criteria

You've succeeded this week if you:

✅ Completed pre-class exercises (green tests)
✅ Participated in live coding
✅ Have a working game from class
✅ Completed post-class exercises
✅ Understand basic Java OOP

## Tips for Success

1. **Complete pre-class work** - You'll be lost without it
2. **Take notes during live coding** - Capture key ideas
3. **Ask "why" not just "how"** - Understanding > memorization
4. **Experiment** - Try variations in post-class exercises
5. **Use Git** - Commit frequently, never lose work

## Looking Ahead

This week might feel "easy" if you already know Java basics. That's intentional! Week 2 will challenge you more. Week 3 will blow your mind.

The journey is: comfortable → uncomfortable → enlightened.

Trust the process! 🚀
