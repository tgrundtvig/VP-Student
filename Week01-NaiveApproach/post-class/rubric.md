## Next Steps Based on Score

### If you scored 90-100:
🎉 Excellent! Try the [extension challenges](extensions/) or help classmates.

### If you scored 75-89:
✅ Good work! Consider refining the features that aren't quite right.

### If you scored 60-74:
📚 Review the hints and try to complete missing features.

### If you scored <60:
🤔 Review the material, check hints, and ask for help. Don't be discouraged - this is a learning process!

## Remember

- This is self-assessment - be honest with yourself
- The goal is learning, not a perfect score
- Identifying weaknesses helps you improve
- Week 2 will build on this foundation
- You can always revisit and improve later
