# Pre-Class Verification

Use this checklist to verify you're ready for Week 1 class.

## Technical Setup

- [ ] Java 21 is installed (`java -version` shows 21.x.x)
- [ ] Maven is installed (`mvn -version` works)
- [ ] IntelliJ IDEA is installed and configured
- [ ] Can create and run Java projects

## Pre-Class Material

- [ ] Read [reading.md](reading.md) completely
- [ ] Understand classes and objects
- [ ] Understand ArrayList and HashMap
- [ ] Understand basic game loop pattern

## Pre-Class Exercises

- [ ] Completed all TODOs in Character.java
- [ ] Completed all TODOs in Inventory.java
- [ ] Completed all TODOs in CombatCalculator.java
- [ ] Ran `mvn test` in exercises folder
- [ ] **All tests pass** ✅ (This is the key requirement!)

## Understanding Check

Can you explain these concepts?

### Classes and Objects
- [ ] What's the difference between a class and an object?
- [ ] Why do we make fields private?
- [ ] What's a constructor for?

### Collections
- [ ] When would you use an ArrayList?
- [ ] When would you use a HashMap?
- [ ] How do you iterate over a collection?

### Methods
- [ ] What's the difference between void and returning a value?
- [ ] Why do methods have parameters?
- [ ] What does `this` mean in a method?

## Self-Assessment

**If you can answer "yes" to most of these questions, you're ready!**

1. Can you create a simple class with fields and methods?
2. Can you use ArrayList to store a list of objects?
3. Can you use HashMap to store key-value pairs?
4. Do you understand what a game loop does?
5. Are all your exercise tests passing?

## If You're Not Ready

**Don't panic!** Here's what to do:

### Tests Not Passing?
1. Read the error messages carefully
2. Look at the test code to see what's expected
3. Check [reading.md](reading.md) for relevant concepts
4. Try one test at a time
5. Ask for help if stuck!

### Concepts Unclear?
1. Review [reading.md](reading.md) sections
2. Look up Java tutorials online
3. Watch Java basics videos
4. Come to class anyway - we'll review together

### Technical Issues?
1. Check [setup-guide.md](../../setup-guide.md)
2. Ask classmates for help
3. Contact instructor before class

## Green Tests = Ready! ✅

If your tests are green, you're prepared for class. The exercises prove you understand the basics.

**In class**, we'll use these concepts to build something much more interesting together!

## Bring to Class

- Laptop with Java, Maven, and IntelliJ installed
- Your completed exercises (we may reference them)
- Questions about anything unclear
- Enthusiasm for coding! 🚀

See you in class!
