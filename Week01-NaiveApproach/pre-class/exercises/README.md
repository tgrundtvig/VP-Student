# Pre-Class Exercises: Java Fundamentals

These exercises verify your understanding of basic Java concepts needed for Week 1.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Java 21 and Maven installed (see [setup-guide.md](../../../setup-guide.md))
2. Navigate to this directory in your terminal
3. Run `mvn clean test` to see which tests fail

## Exercises

Complete the TODO sections in these files:

1. **Character.java** - Basic class with fields and methods
2. **Inventory.java** - Working with collections
3. **CombatCalculator.java** - Simple game logic

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run tests for specific class
mvn test -Dtest=CharacterTest

# Compile without testing
mvn compile
```

## Success Criteria

✅ All tests pass (green)
✅ No compilation errors
✅ Code follows the TODO instructions

## When You're Done

All tests passing? Great! You're ready for class.

Check [verification.md](../verification.md) for a final self-assessment.

## Need Help?

- Review [reading.md](../reading.md) for concept explanations
- Check Java documentation
- Ask in class or via communication channel

## Hints

- Read test files to understand what's expected
- Start with the simplest TODO first (Character class)
- Test frequently as you work
- Don't overthink it - these are warm-up exercises!

Good luck! 🚀
