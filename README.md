# Advanced Programming (Videregående Programmering)

Welcome to the Advanced Programming course! This is a 14-week evening course designed for adult learners, focusing on modern software design principles and professional development practices.

## Course Philosophy

This course teaches **interface-first, top-down design thinking** - a powerful methodology for building maintainable, testable, and professional software systems. You'll learn to design first, then implement, following the principle of "wishful programming."

## Course Structure

### Format
- **Duration**: 14 weeks + 2-week implementation period
- **Schedule**: One evening per week, 17:00-20:00 (3 hours)
- **Language**: English (all written materials and code)
- **Classroom**: Danish (spoken language during teaching)

### Weekly Pattern

Each week follows a consistent structure:

**Before Class (1.5-2 hours):**
1. Read the pre-class material
2. Complete simple confirmation exercises
3. Run automated tests to verify understanding
4. ✅ Green tests = ready for class

**During Class (3 hours):**
- Live coding demonstrations
- Socratic discussions
- Hands-on practice
- Collaborative problem-solving

**After Class (2-3 hours):**
- Complete advanced exercises
- Use hints and rubrics for self-assessment
- Optional: explore extension challenges
- Solutions provided after submission

### Course Phases

**Phase 1: Discovery (Weeks 1-4)**
Experience the pain of poor design, then discover interface-first solutions

**Phase 2: Mastery (Weeks 5-10)**
Deep dive into data structures, algorithms, and design patterns through interfaces

**Phase 3: Application (Weeks 11-14)**
Design your exam project with peer feedback and refinement

**Phase 4: Implementation (2-week gap)**
Implement your designed system independently

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Design software systems using interface-first methodology
- Apply top-down thinking to break complex problems into manageable layers
- Distinguish between data (records) and behavior (interfaces)
- Write testable code with clear separation of concerns
- Implement data structures and algorithms from first principles
- Apply design patterns naturally through interface-driven design
- Build complete applications using modern Java practices

## Technical Requirements

- Java 21 LTS
- Maven (build tool)
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended IDE)
- Git and GitHub account (strongly recommended)

See [setup-guide.md](setup-guide.md) for detailed installation instructions.

## How to Succeed

### Essential
1. ✅ **Complete pre-class work** - This is mandatory preparation
2. ✅ **Run the tests** - Green tests = you understand the concepts
3. ✅ **Attend class** - Live coding and discussions are irreplaceable
4. ✅ **Do post-class exercises** - Practice solidifies understanding
5. ✅ **Use GitHub** - Professional workflow and portfolio building

### Recommended
- 📚 Start assignments early - don't wait until the last day
- 👥 Discuss with classmates - learn from each other
- 💬 Ask questions - there are no stupid questions
- 🔍 Explore extensions - deepen your understanding
- 🎯 Focus on design - implementation will follow naturally

## Assessment

### Weekly Exercises
- Pre-class: Confirmed by passing automated tests
- Post-class: Self-assessed using provided rubrics
- Solutions provided after submission

### Final Project
- **Weeks 11-14**: Design phase (architecture, interfaces, tests)
- **2-week gap**: Implementation phase
- **Exam**: Project presentation and code review

Your project demonstrates your ability to apply interface-first design to a real-world problem of your choice.

## Getting Help

## Important Principles

### Interface-First Design
1. Define what modules do (interfaces) before how they do it (implementation)
2. Use records for data, interfaces for behavior
3. Design all layers before implementing the leaves
4. Write tests against interfaces, not implementations

### Code Standards
- **All code in English** - variables, methods, classes, comments
- **Clear naming** - code should read like prose
- **Comprehensive tests** - prove your design works
- **Professional practices** - this prepares you for real work

## Ready to Start?

1. Follow the [setup-guide.md](setup-guide.md) to install required tools
2. Read [how-to-use-github.md](how-to-use-github.md) to set up version control
3. Navigate to Week01-NaiveApproach and begin!

---

**Remember**: The goal isn't just to write code that works. The goal is to learn how to *think* about software design in a way that scales to real-world complexity. Trust the process, embrace the methodology, and you'll be amazed at what you can build.

Good luck! 🚀
