# Week 10 Pre-Class Exercises: Architecture Analysis

## Overview

These exercises test your understanding of the example projects' architecture.
Complete them **after** studying the Task Manager and Quiz App.

**Important:** This week's exercises are written analysis, not coding.
Fill in your answers in the `ArchitectureAnalysis.java` file.

## Exercise Instructions

1. Open `src/main/java/dk/viprogram/week10/ArchitectureAnalysis.java`
2. Study the example projects (in `example-projects/`)
3. Fill in the string constants with your answers
4. Run the tests to verify your understanding

## What You'll Analyze

### Task Manager Analysis
- Interface hierarchy
- Data flow for "complete task" action
- Why certain design decisions were made

### Quiz App Analysis
- Polymorphism in Question types
- Strategy pattern in scoring
- Repository usage

### Comparison
- Similarities between the projects
- Patterns that appear in both
- How the same principles apply differently

## Running the Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

The tests check that you've provided thoughtful answers (not just empty strings).
Some tests also verify specific technical understanding.

## Time Estimate

60-90 minutes to:
1. Study both example projects carefully
2. Complete all analysis questions
3. Pass all tests

## Tips

- Have the example project code open while answering
- Draw diagrams to understand the structure
- Think about WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT was done
- Consider how you might apply these patterns to your own project
