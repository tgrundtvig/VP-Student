# Week 10 Pre-Class Verification

## Before Class Checklist

Complete this checklist to verify you're ready for class:

### Example Projects Studied
- [ ] I have cloned/downloaded the example projects
- [ ] I have run both Task Manager and Quiz App
- [ ] I have read the README files for both projects
- [ ] I have examined the source code structure

### Architecture Understanding
- [ ] I can identify the interfaces in Task Manager
- [ ] I can explain why MockTaskView exists
- [ ] I can trace data flow for a user action
- [ ] I understand why entities are records

### Pattern Recognition
- [ ] I can identify the MVC pattern in both projects
- [ ] I can identify the Repository pattern
- [ ] I can explain the Strategy pattern in Quiz App
- [ ] I understand how polymorphism is used with Question types

### Analysis Complete
- [ ] I have filled in all answers in ArchitectureAnalysis.java
- [ ] All tests pass when I run `mvn test`

### Project Planning Started
- [ ] I have an initial project idea
- [ ] I can describe what entities my project will have
- [ ] I have identified at least 2 interfaces my project needs

## Running Verification

```bash
cd pre-class/exercises
mvn test
```

**Expected output:** All 15 tests should pass.

## If Tests Fail

The tests verify:
1. Your answers are not empty
2. Your answers have sufficient detail
3. You mention key concepts where appropriate

If a test fails:
- Read the test assertion message
- Provide more detail in your answer
- Make sure you've actually studied the example projects

## Questions to Bring to Class

Write down any questions you have about:
- Design decisions in the examples
- How to apply patterns to your own project
- Trade-offs between different approaches
- Anything unclear about the architecture

Good questions lead to good discussions!
